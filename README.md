# Image-Captioning-AI
The image captioning model consists of an encoder and a decoder. The encoder extracts out important features from the image. The decoder takes those features as inputs and uses them to generate the caption. Typically, we use ImageNet Pretrained networks like VGGNet or ResNet as the encoder for the image.
